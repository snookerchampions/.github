Tournament winners over the last year have booked their places at the prestigious non-ranking event, which Mark Allen won last year as he beat Judd Trump in the final.

It is a hugely busy time on the snooker calendar as the International Championship comes to an end on Sunday in Nanjing, China and the Champion of Champions begins in Lancashire, England just hours later.

Ding Junhui has grabbed the final spot in the tournament by winning the International Championship on Sunday for the chance to play Judd Trump on Wednesday.
